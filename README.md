# CommitSense ðŸ¤–

CommitSense is a command-line tool and GitHub Action designed to automate semantic versioning and changelog generation by analyzing Git commit messages using AI. It leverages language models like OpenAI's GPT series to understand the significance of changes since the last release point and suggest the appropriate next version.

## Features

* **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses AI (configurable model) to interpret commit messages.
* **Semantic Versioning:** Suggests `major`, `minor`, or `patch` bumps based on Conventional Commits patterns (or AI's interpretation).
* **Automated Changelog:** Generates a Markdown changelog section summarizing key changes.
* **Flexible Release Point Discovery:** Finds the "last release" using:
    * Explicit Git ref (`--base-ref`).
    * Glob patterns for tags (`--tag-pattern`).
    * Regex patterns for tags (`--tag-regex`).
    * Conventional commit messages (`release: ...`).
    * Latest SemVer tag (fallback).
    * Initial repository commit (ultimate fallback).
* **Project Type Support:** Works with Rust (`Cargo.toml`) and JavaScript/TypeScript (`package.json`) projects. Auto-detects or allows explicit type setting.
* **Monorepo Friendly:** Use the `--path` argument to target specific packages within a monorepo.
* **GitHub Action:** Easily integrates into your CI/CD pipeline.
* **Dry Run Mode:** Runs read-only by default; use `--write` to modify files.

## Installation (CLI - Requires Rust)

1.  Ensure you have Rust installed: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/commitsense.git` (Replace URL)
3.  Navigate to the directory: `cd commitsense`
4.  Build the release binary: `cargo build --release`
5.  The executable will be at `./target/release/commitsense`. You can copy this to a location in your PATH.

## Usage (CLI)

```bash
# Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# --- Examples ---

# Dry run in current directory (auto-detect project type, find last release automatically)
./target/release/commitsense

# Dry run for a JS sub-package, finding last release via tag pattern
./target/release/commitsense --path ./packages/my-lib --project-type js --tag-pattern "v*.*.*"

# Dry run, explicitly comparing against the 'main' branch
./target/release/commitsense --base-ref main

# Apply changes (update version file and CHANGELOG.md) in current dir
./target/release/commitsense --write

# Get help
./target/release/commitsense --help
```

## GitHub Action Usage

Add the following workflow to your GitHub repository:

```yaml
name: CommitSense

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Run CommitSense
        uses: your-username/commitsense@v1
        with:
          openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          # Optional parameters:
          # project_path: ./packages/my-package  # For monorepos
          # write: "true"  # Enable write mode
```
